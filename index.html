  <h1>Lab 1</h1>
  <p>Hello world. ðŸ‘‹ This is my first assignment.</p>
  <p>My name is Juan Gonzalez and I am a second year student at Illinois Tech.</p>
  <p>My major is Computer Information Systems and I have a minor in Information Technology and Management.</p>
  <p>I have always wanted to create my own website and am glad that this class will help me with that.</p>
  <p>I will also get to use my Github account more, which is an added bonus.</p>
